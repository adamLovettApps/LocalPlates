Once we were seated, it was another 10 minutes before any server came to greet our table and get our drink orders.",

        "body":"Went during restaurant week on a Monday with a group of five, including myself. Apparently they automatically add a 20% tip for groups of this size, which explains why the service was basically non-existent. Our food arrived before our silverware did, a simple mistake which took far too long to correct as our waiter was nowhere to be found. Drink refills were also hard to come by.",

So itâ€™s a great place to come by for either dinner or just a drink after work or on the weekend. Plenty of vegetarian friendly items also and a whole spectrum of price points for dishes from pricier entrees to reasonably priced sandwiches and platters.",
